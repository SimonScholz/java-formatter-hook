== Formatting Java Code Automatically

This repo is based on this article: http://www.mopri.de/2018/format-projects-java-code-git-hooks-finally-rid-annoying-ide-specifics/

Struggling with formatting issues when reviewing pullrequests can be a pain.
Having a commit hook, which is capable to do this automatically can help to avoid this pain.

== Possible issues

=== Windows

* The _formatter.sh_ file should have unix line endings (Can be swiched by using Notepad++)

=== Ecipse EGit on Windows

To properly run the _formatter.sh_ script EGit needs cygwin (https://cygwin.com/install.html) to be installed.
And the _bin_ folder of the cygwin installation also has to be added to the path, e.g., _C:\cygwin64\bin_.
